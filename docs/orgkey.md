# Transaction Manager key management at Organization level
Currently when private transactions are done Quorum, the individual transaction manager (Tessera or Constellation) public keys have to be mentioned in the `privateFor` attribute. This feature allows multiple transaction manager keys to be grouped under a single organization name and at transaction level, the organization id can be passed in `privateFor` attribute instead of the keys.
